/*
Feature methods are the heart of a specification. They describe the features (properties, aspects) that you expect to find in the system under specification. By convention, feature methods are named with String literals. Try to choose good names for your feature methods, and feel free to use any characters you like!

Conceptually, a feature method consists of four phases:

Set up the feature's fixture
Provide a stimulus to the system under specification
Describe the response expected from the system
Clean up the feature's fixture
Whereas the first and last phases are optional, the stimulus and response phases are always present (except in interacting feature methods), and may occur more than once.
